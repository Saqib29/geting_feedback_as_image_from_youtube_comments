0,Newsthink,*NOTE: This is a revised and updated version of my previous Earth to Earth video  as I wanted to address the question of whether the Super Heavy booster will be needed for these trips. New info starts @2:20 in. Now the question is...would you take a trip to another city on Starship?!,False
1,Ian Guzman,If I had the money I'd go for a ride just to hear that SpaceX tech say: "Thanks for Flying SpaceX".,False
2,Summer Mkj,This channel is getting very less attention than it should. I would rate 10/10 for the content and storytelling .,False

11,Caleb Reasons,Wait  I thought we were having a climate change problem? So why are we talking about the billionaires taking rockets from New York to Dubai?,False

15,mikegonsalves11,I'd do it in a heartbeat,False
16,robert gunkelman,30 minute trip sounds nice until you have to stand in security for an hour. Then boarding takes another hour if not more because it's a rocket. Then finally after you land  wait an hour for crews to get you out of the rocket and safely in the terminal again. And probably another hour waiting at baggage claim just find out your suitcase got to Tokyo just fine in 30 minutes.,False

67,Agostino Silvestri,The question that intrigues me most  is about the Starship main utilization: "Would you travel for months  to start living in a planet where you can only survive with a space suit? Or would you just hope to survive to the asteroids on Earth?",False
68,Newsthink,I thought it was important to include information about the super heavy booster not being part of the flight - as that could significantly bring down costs.,False
69,Nishan Rajbhandari,@Newsthink yea i noticed that ... im sorryy ... i was just listening to it .. so i couldnt find the difference at the time,False
