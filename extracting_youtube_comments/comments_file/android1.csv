45,aRUnKA,@Ananya GuptaNonsense. Gmail  google search and the platform you're on: youtube  all come from google.Even if they generate less profit than the likes of Apple  google has succeeded in connecting the world and changed the way we share information.Look at the likes of android and Google's contribution to open-source.,False

52,Keith Hernandez,@YouTube police ok?,False
53,aRUnKA,@OS WAR'SThe pixel hasn't even launched in India yet  what are you talking about?Obviously  the statement still holds true for anyone able to get the pixel at its original pricing. Imo  it would still be worth it at 400+ dollars.,False
54,aRUnKA,@OS WAR'SI think their point  is that you should buy phones from a reliable brand  if updates/security are actually important to you.I hope you're not insinuating that android doesn't have other good options. Samsung  Nokia  OnePlus  are good candidates.Edit: News tells me that some Xiaomi  OnePlus  Samsung  realme  Oppo  phones are all getting android 11 today.Google has changed many gears  so that android updates are easier than ever.,False

63,arisoda,@Anrijs Christopher The encryption is not open-source  and does it need to be said...? It's Facebook...Closed-source and Facebook are not always bad  but when there is a PERFECT alternative  why the FCK are we kidding ourselves? We need to change platform...,False
64,ーミスター,I wish RCS was better implemented. I don't like having to use Facebook Messenger for a specific group  WhatsApp for another just because they use it.Please be more like iMessage.,False
65,Nuhash Tarafdar,LMAO all Android features are copied from Apple,False
66,Sir Delta,@Nuhash Tarafdar low effort bait.,False
67,That guy named Tyler,@Nuhash Tarafdar Yeah uh huh "all" are we not gonna talk about iPhones newest update?,False
68,Nuhash Tarafdar,@Sir Delta Atleast someone took it,False
69,YouTube police,@Nuhash Tarafdar lol nice joke,False
70,Little Aurelion,@Nuhash Tarafdar android didn't steal it from apple community  apple community stole samsung and google innovation like wireless charging and widgets,False
71,aRUnKA,@Nuhash Tarafdar"Atleast someone took it"Funny how fast your stance changed.And besides  apple has copied features from android from the beginning  without which you wouldn't even be able to change your wallpaper  get notifications  control center  OTA updates (despite apple doing better at updates these days)  typing suggestions  app communication  etc. The list goes on  this doesn't even include features from custom skins.Apple doesn't "do it better". That phrase comes from people who don't use android to begin with.,False
72,Electron,@Nuhash Tarafdar have you seen iOS 14  where did the widgets  the app drawer and picture in picture come from,False
73,IkoNik,Apple is “but better”,False

83,Blizzard,Good decision,False
84,Kamran Younis,They both have their own pros and cons. Different OS' for different people. If you want security and simplicity then use an IOS device  if you want Variety and freedom get android. Comparing each one is like comparing a rolls to a lambo  different products for different people.,False
85,YouTube police,@Kamran Younis android is more simple and secure tbh,False
86,JEFF FRANK,@Kamran Younis Agree,False
87,aRUnKA,@YouTube policeSimplicity and ease of use are subjective.But I would agree somewhat with the security aspect. Security isn't an easily measurable quantity  but android has many advantages:•while apple has a stricter store policy  it is more susceptible to attack.•Worse cloud security on iCloud. Not end-to-end encrypted.•Android's open-source model of security  is easier to patch than apple's closed code.•Although SMS is less secure  everyone uses WhatsApp  which is actually more secure than iMessage. There are plenty of third party options  on both.•Up to date Android phones are harder to crack than ios devices  if an attacker has physical access to it  etc.Android is more secure in many ways. In the end  again  which OS you pick is down to your personal preference.,False
88,YouTube police,@aRUnKA ok but to be honest android is more simple and aesthetic,False
89,Itsfadi,@YouTube police I know like ios is jail wdym I can't install moded apps,False
90,cowegg,Kamran Younis Stop repeating that same old nonsense “iOs Is SiMpLe AnD sEcUre” lol no. My parents use Samsung and I have thought of buying them an iPhone but they are too used to having the back button on the navigation bar. A lot of the apps they use like Truecaller work much better on Android. And knowing that they won’t be trapping into Apple’s walled garden also gives me peace of mind.,False
91,cowegg,aRUnKALack of end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups and iMessages being sent as SMS in some cases makes iPhones significantly less secure out of the box for most users.,False
92,aRUnKA,@coweggI wrote the same thing —but the comment is bit confusing. I'll edit for clarity.,False

240,Yashwanth R,@TacoFingerss woah!,False
241,aRUnKA,Not true. Android 11 brings power settings  notifications  etc.And besides the main improvement with android updates is always performance  security  app optimizations  under the hood.Even if you had oneUI 3 but were running android KitKat  your apps would be much slower  and buggier. Besides  with this newer updates  android phones are becoming much easier to update —notice samsung now promising 3+ years of updates?,False
