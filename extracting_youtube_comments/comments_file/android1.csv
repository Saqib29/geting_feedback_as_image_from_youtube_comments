54,aRUnKA,@OS WAR'SI think their point  is that you should buy phones from a reliable brand  if updates/security are actually important to you.I hope you're not insinuating that android doesn't have other good options. Samsung  Nokia  OnePlus  are good candidates.Edit: News tells me that some Xiaomi  OnePlus  Samsung  realme  Oppo  phones are all getting android 11 today.Google has changed many gears  so that android updates are easier than ever.,False

70,Little Aurelion,@Nuhash Tarafdar android didn't steal it from apple community  apple community stole samsung and google innovation like wireless charging and widgets,False
71,aRUnKA,@Nuhash Tarafdar"Atleast someone took it"Funny how fast your stance changed.And besides  apple has copied features from android from the beginning  without which you wouldn't even be able to change your wallpaper  get notifications  control center  OTA updates (despite apple doing better at updates these days)  typing suggestions  app communication  etc. The list goes on  this doesn't even include features from custom skins.Apple doesn't "do it better". That phrase comes from people who don't use android to begin with.,False

84,Kamran Younis,They both have their own pros and cons. Different OS' for different people. If you want security and simplicity then use an IOS device  if you want Variety and freedom get android. Comparing each one is like comparing a rolls to a lambo  different products for different people.,False
85,YouTube police,@Kamran Younis android is more simple and secure tbh,False
86,JEFF FRANK,@Kamran Younis Agree,False
87,aRUnKA,@YouTube policeSimplicity and ease of use are subjective.But I would agree somewhat with the security aspect. Security isn't an easily measurable quantity  but android has many advantages:‚Ä¢while apple has a stricter store policy  it is more susceptible to attack.‚Ä¢Worse cloud security on iCloud. Not end-to-end encrypted.‚Ä¢Android's open-source model of security  is easier to patch than apple's closed code.‚Ä¢Although SMS is less secure  everyone uses WhatsApp  which is actually more secure than iMessage. There are plenty of third party options  on both.‚Ä¢Up to date Android phones are harder to crack than ios devices  if an attacker has physical access to it  etc.Android is more secure in many ways. In the end  again  which OS you pick is down to your personal preference.,False

A lot of the apps they use like Truecaller work much better on Android. And knowing that they won‚Äôt be trapping into Apple‚Äôs walled garden also gives me peace of mind.,False
91,cowegg,aRUnKALack of end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups and iMessages being sent as SMS in some cases makes iPhones significantly less secure out of the box for most users.,False
