The only feature fromthis that Apple doesn’t have is bubbles but I don’t think Apple users want that anyways. But it’s normal for companies to copy from each other. It makes them both the best they can be.,False

185,Asmit,@TECH J They have figured out how to keep all devices to the latest android. Search for project treble. But others are not implementing it.,False
186,J L,Great. Now Android just needs an adoption rate as fast as Apple. A huge challenge for Google I'd say.,False

191,V Kat,FortydroidG Yea I totally agree  I would love to see iOS on other devices  but I guess it would lose its stability  and Apple would never do it of course  so Android is doing very well on this field  from time to time i switch to Android  they only issue is apps  you buy something for iOS and then you have to buy it again on Android or it doesn’t exist at all...,False
192,Mas Mas,Hopefully there will be feature like minimized app without pausing it  natively. In gaming perspective it will come very handy cause alot game have auto feature these day. Considering nowdays phone have big Ram and good chipset that basically can handling it easily. Also split screen that can handle 3 app simultaneously cause phone had become bigger and high screen to body ratio.,False
193,aRUnKA,@J LI'd agree  but for apple they don't have an "adoption rate" per se. It's just that the only phone that adopt iOS are iPhones.Many of Google's improvements aren't widely adopted. For eg:•biometrics API— apps recognise verification  regardless of type. Instead making developers integrate fingerprint/face unlock/etc separately•CameraX api— so that apps can take full advantage of your hardware.These were implemented in 8 9. Many apps don't use them. But that can easily change  and google keeps improving the update situation.,False

273,Zuhayr Zaheer,@Luca Meleleo It was...,False
274,Luca Meleleo,@Zuhayr Zaheer yep...that's true! Sadly (at least in my opinion) apple is not innovating  it's always the same thing from iphone 10 or so. Although  I do believe that soon (because of samsung  motorola  xiaomi etc creating new and original smartphones  like the folding ones) they will create something very cool. At least I hope!,False
275,Flaying Cat,@Marius Hofert alot of people says samsung has alot of bloatware but i use S10 and i dont even see any crashes  lags  or ads that just pop out of nowhere,False
276,Flaying Cat,@Nezunish - agree,False
277,FLIM : Gaming Stuff,@Journey to Alex yup! What did I say? You had to wait so many years for a basic function like customisation! On the other hand  even when Android didn't officially have s teen recording  we could do it. iOS is closed and that is the reason you had to wait so many years to get that basic feature 😂,False

282,Journey to Alex,FLIM : Gaming Stuff FLIM : Gaming Stuff I’m happy with my phone. It can do everything I need. I’m not even interested in Android. This vid just popped up on my time line & then I got curious. I don’t know what to say. How was I waiting? These are not life altering changes... I never thought about any of these features much.About customisation on Android I think it is great but I don’t want it for Apple ... I’m even sad that Apple will have widgets soon. I don’t find them useful. I used to use Samsung phones and I never used any of the customisations options and hated the openness of the OS. I felt like I had to make decisions all the time even tho I just wanted to use my phone. Personally I’m not a fan of all this customisation. Also I really don’t ever wake up and think: oh I’m so sad I can’t place a widget here or I’m sad I can’t change the design of my phones software.Won’t leave Apple soon and I just hope everyone enjoys their phone as much as I enjoy mine no matter whether it’s from Apple or Samsung or runs android.,False

397,Akash Sajjan,Well I have a poco f1  it has an sd 845 chipset  powerful enough to run android 11 12 13. Still xiaomi won’t be giving us the update.

410,Bujaboy,@V Kat  Actually  Samsung  had that for years too.,False
411,pritam,Guys tell me   does it habe internal sound recording?,False
412,thelco1,@pritam Yes.,False
413,FLIM : Gaming Stuff,@V Kat lmao 😂Just because iOS got a feature that you could do in any android as well  doesn't mean iOS is better. So many things android has been able to do which are dreams for iOS users.,False
414,V Kat,FLIM : Gaming Stuff “iOS” is the most useless OS? 😂😂😂 are you sure about that? You know you just said really stupid shit  i can easily prove that Android is useless  to me at least  lets take sound editing  I tried Android for this  most of the apps that i need  just don’t exist on this platform  while on iOS i have pretty much everything i couldn’t even dream about  same thing with photo editing  only recently Adobe came out with some useful apps for Android  but again  same apps on iOS perform much better  and there are reasons for this  Android runs on 1000s different devices  while iOS runs on few  thats why it has its benefits  thats all  Android is more useful for some DIY shit  its open and you can do anything you like with it  but average consumer doesn’t give a shit about this... Im not saying Android is bad  its just iOS is better for most use cases we do every day... Now you tell me why iOS is useless? Especially when you have ability to jailbrake it and do anything you can imagine  please  im listening to you sir!,False
415,FLIM : Gaming Stuff,@V Kat you literally proved me right yourself 😂You need to JAILBREAK iOS for even the most basic stuff! All those things you can already do on Android!Apps not available? Are you alright? It has literally almost all the apps that you would get on iOS excluding of course official Apple apps. Maybe you would get them when you try to find rather than using your bloatware 😂And you said it yourself! iOS is only good for the basic things. It can't even do anything extraordinary or special! Anything possible on iOS that is not on Android? 🤔Plus  saying that jailbreaking gives you access is the most pointless argument! 😂That isn't even official! If that's the case  root and Android and see what all it can do! Probably you can't even imagine its power in your dreams!Android is the best for both every-day work and DIY stuff that you iOS users can't even do in your dreams 😂I mean  you can't even do customisations on your OWN phone! 🤣🤣🤣🤣,False
416,V Kat,FLIM : Gaming Stuff O yesss!!! The holy grail of all Android fans “the holy customization” you telling me about how good Android? Believe me i know much more about these platforms than you can imagine  because i owned both of them  I’m a busy person  i don’t have time for some stupid customization shit  changing icons  make them fly or talk  lets leave it to teenagers like you  in not saying im old  (34) but all this “customization” hype  is over rated  at the end of day you just want things to work the way they should... By the way i just checked for some apps that i was looking for on Android  and they still don’t exist  because of the latency issues with Android  and for professional stuff  im using windows or macOS if im home  Apps that don’t exist on Android: Sugar Bytes (not even one app from them) Waves (not even one) Shell i continue with apps that don’t exist on Android? Those are not made apple by the way!,False
417,thelco1,@V Kat No one ever said iOS was useless so why are you arguing lmao. There are many sound editing apps on Android. It's all just up to personal preference. I believe iOS and Android both have really strong features. It's just up to that user's desires and tastes.,False
418,Mez352,@V Kat at least on android u can get paid stuff for free  i shouldn't mention this  but it's definitely a plus,False

432,Zuhayr Zaheer,Christian Vlogs good for you! 😃,False
433,Darth El,@V Kat and thats exactly why ios is behind android  lack of individuality. You yourself said customization is overrated but who cares about you? There are a plethora of xda developers from your age and up who's passion is to increase the functionality and customization of android. There are millions of people who grow tired of how a launcher looks  how an app works  or how their phones basic core functions operate and want to change it. There are people who want to make their phones better  without waiting for an annual update that may or may not fit their needs. Should they be blocked because pretentious pricks like you deem it unnecessary? Customization and freedom are never bad things. You dont like it? Fine do you. But dont limit the experiences of others based on your whims and biasCute how you think apps not being on android matters considering android has more apps than the app store on the play store alone. There are dozens of other venders to chose from like galaxy apps and aptode.,False

472,Lone Ranger,@Flaying Cat you're probably on the latest version they r somewhat clean only since they introduced one UI,False
473,Sack 200,I have them all in one UI 2.5,False
474,J L,aRUnKA then they’ll have to enforce it legally  or via other measures. Because Google is struggling to do so at this point. iPhone users can pretty much choose not to upgrade to the latest OS if they want to tbh.,False
475,FLIM : Gaming Stuff,Tbh  that is why Android is better. It is open source and allows developers to implement any features/changes.Take iOS for example. It is restricted. If you want a feature  you need to wait years for Apple to add it. This is what makes Android much better and gives it an upper edge. You can make your own android,False
476,aRUnKA,@J LLegal action would be the worst option  imo. I prefer Google's lenient strategy  instead of forcing developers to update their apps.As for actual OS updates  it's mainly up to OEMs to port android for a specific phone. It's not like users are holding back with updating  they just usually don't get em —unless they're running a custom ROM.Google already has implemented things like project treble  etc. These will improve the update situation easily  and google can afford to wait. Things are definitely changing.,False

776,Averything,Android operating system has always been more amazing and modern than iOS.,False
777,Asyiqin Zulkifli,So  pleading emoji~,False
778,Lionel Cepeda,Waiting on my pixel 2 XL,False
779,Tanvir Shafi,Please try atleast 4 years of updates on Pixel devices! And optimization on every other devices.,False
780,Md Riadul Kamal Jisan,I watch this video with my 5.1 version phone 😂😂,False
781,Chris,Watching This While My Phone Is Currently On Android 9 OS huhu,False
782,James,I can't get the Bubbles to work at all. I have everything enabled in settings and in Messages... They don't show up. Running Pixel 3 XL,False
783,GenesisGems,E2E isn't good enough. Use the Signal app,False
784,aRUnKA,@GenesisGemsWhatsapp is also pretty secure  which is what most people use anyways,False
785,GenesisGems,@aRUnKA it's secure to outsiders but whatsapp has full access to your metadata and shares it to facebook. That metadata is then used for advertisement and sold to other companies.,False
786,aRUnKA,@GenesisGems hmm true  I just wanted to point out that android didn't need to implement its own specific messaging apps. There are plenty of great 3rd party options  and this could interfere with other businesses.I see it compared to iMessage all the time  but honestly apple has some extremely anti-competitive policies --android is a much more even playing field  for 3rd party apps  i wouldnt want that to change.,False
787,hoofhearted4,Default E2E would be awesome. Getting people to use Signal is almost impossible.,False
788,GenesisGems,@hoofhearted4 I agree. Signal's level of security would need to be mandated by law in order for that level of protection to be widespread. Your average consumer is too dumb or lazy to understand the importance,False
789,AdmiralD.rifter,The A51 has it if youre looking for one. Excellent phone.,False
790,olly nweze,@Kaweesha Nethmika check button order,False

793,Kaweesha Nethmika,@Rix Zin 😔😔,False
794,olly nweze,@Kaweesha Nethmika you need to sign up for Google beta testing it's not officially out till Android 11,False
795,Saakshar Shah,@JavaScript nope  I have a galaxy m21 with one ui 2.0 but it doesn't have a screen recorder. Its for the A series and the flaghship Samsungs  I hope they add screen recorder to the budget samsungs out there. Actually  the game launcher does have the screen recording feature but that only works with games  not other apps.,False
796,aRUnKA,@Palash BaruahIt's not about "copying". Third party recording apps have existed for years. It's about implementing a feature that is able to run on hundreds of devices  and form factors  not just a single one.,False
797,Palash Baruah,@aRUnKA Honor  Huawei  Realme  Oppo  Samsung already sold millions of devices with that feature  not just 'a single one'.,False
798,aRUnKA,@Palash BaruahI don't think you understood. I meant implementing features on individual devices  instead of making software that runs on all android phones.Google improves APIs  security  etc that change even the way your phone performs. It's not the same as simply adding features on top of the OS.Screen recording is nothing big  it's not even stolen from other OEMs  as apps have had this functionality for a while. But you weren't able to record internal audio  without certain privacy convcerns.,False
799,Flaying Cat,they already did my samsung A50 got that feature,False
800,Flaying Cat,@Saakshar Shah well my samsung A50 with OneUI 2.0 got that screen recording feature,False
801,Saakshar Shah,@Flaying Cat yeah thats what I told  A series get these features but now the m51 which has been launched recently  has screen recorder as well as nfc  but no knox features  secure folder  etc. Thats why A series phones are priced little higher,False
802,Prathamesh Gawde,All these stock features will be ruined by..OppoVivoRealmeetc.. etc..😅Only option left is to use Pixel phone,False
803,Sankalp Kotewar,Everything is already present in current versions of android or can be brought in via some app. Where's the innovation? The video animation seems more innovative to me than the entire list of features of Android 11. Come on guys!,False

827,Khairul Hafiz,Personally  Android is lacking only one thing. I'm using Samsung and this thing bugs me a lot. They really have to start working on camera quality on social media apps. I know it's hard but I think it is feasible. I'm all in for the filter on instagram and snapchat but the camera quality is just disappointing...,False
828,Flaying Cat,@Khairul Hafiz its just the app developer that don't want optimise it  its not android fault,False
829,Khairul Hafiz,@Flaying Cat Is it? I didn't know that. But can't Google at least try to do something about it? Maybe talk to them 🙃 I heard someone said it could be done thru API versions. It might be tedious but it's such a drawback..,False
830,Ervan 2607,@Khairul Hafiz there are lots of brand and phone so they can't optimise it all,False

849,HunterDixonRick The Walking Dead News Everyday,always no solution to power consumption in Android.... Every time it is worse 🤷‍♂️,False
850,El Zion,Most of these functions  are already on Samsung One Ui.. guess its safe to say Samsung  set the  pace again for  Android 11 as it did 10,False

887,Хочу погладить Манула,Lol it's already realized on ColorOS (UI from oppo),False
888,Assassin Master16,Tbf it sucks for s9 users since I don't think Samsung supports them for 3 years whilst Samsung will support the S10 series for 3 years and above which is pretty good. However if you have a s9 I would wait for next year for the 21 since that is supposed to be really good although if you want a AMD+Exynos then wait till 2022,False
889,Alvin Lenin,@Assassin Master16 I'm on note 8 rn 😂. Only reason y I don't wanna buy another Samsung is  they don't sell Snapdragon version in Australia.,False
890,Assassin Master16,@Alvin Lenin ah right wait for next year and see how much of a performance gap there is between the exynos and the Snapdragon then if there is a 1 second difference then the Exynos is worth it however if you are into gaming on your phone then wait till 2022 because hopefully the AMD partnership should come into play.,False
891,Alvin Lenin,@Assassin Master16 yeh tru  so far my note 8 runs fine  even tho im a heavy user   expect battery life,False

903,JEFF FRANK,@ADARSH Tiwari Yeah Android one in nokia is pretty close to the stock versionAnd I also mentioned that I'm not sure of it btw,False
904,INムCheese567 codm,@vancevoj isn't oneplus meant to be a flagship killer back then. They didn't spend in marketing at all back then. Now? It's filled with 1000 usd flagships and spend majority of the time on marketing. Not saying it's a terrible phone  it's not the same anymore,False
905,INムCheese567 codm,@ADARSH Tiwari oneplus should stick in the high end mid range market now  like the 7 pro,False

935,Jax,@Settiis bruh what,False
936,Jason Jordan,@Settiis shut up android looks nothing like IOS,False
937,Nick Ryan,@Settiis android looks nothing like ios at all,False
938,Radplay,@Settiis Have you ever even USED a modern android device?,False
939,Settiis,@Dibyadarshan lol  I bet I know more about tech than you buddy.,False
940,Settiis,@Radplay Yes  android has made it's user interface minimalistic  mimicing iOS. It's a fact  I'm sorry you android fans are so easily butthurt.,False
941,Settiis,@Dibyadarshan The fact you use android doesn't make you a tech wizard  even if you think so in your small bubble. There's more to consider than specs  but that probably goes over your head by miles.,False
942,Settiis,@Dibyadarshan I'm just stating things how they are. When did I say I'm a tech wizard?😂 I didn't. Trouble reading? By the way  I didn't talk about features  what I meant was  the minimalistic user interface android has blatantly copied. I wrote that btw  but I guess you missed it. How can you say I'm insecure when a simple fact makes you cry like that?😂 I didn't even say one OS is better than another  geez  grow some hair.,False
943,Electron,@Settiis if the interface is copied then how come iOS has stolen the app drawer and widgets  it doesn't take a genius to know that android is nothing like iOS  and is far more special in its own way  and if you want to talk trash to all these people then at least do it with good points instead of insulting them  no using android doesn't make you a tech wizard  but it does help understanding of tech  especially compared to iOSs oversimplified interface  and at least androids features that have been copied have been executed according to Google's and androids own design language  the minimalist interface has been on Android since android 5  the material ui design is relatively minimal  android has not copied from iOS by any means  at least compared to the amount of times iOS has copied from android  so I'm gonna say it to you  grow some hair instead of trying to make everyone angry like an eight year old  plus on your point about the design  minimalism is not an apple invention  so making an OS minimalist isn't mimicking anyone  Microsoft has done it too. Minimalism is part of a growing culture everywhere  not just in iOS  I'm not some insane Android fanboy  if iOS came up with some original ideas and their phones costed less and had more customization  then maybe I'd switch  but android has so many more opportunities and options to utilize  so before making stupid points again  do research  from more than one side of the picture  as I have done,False

948,S NR,Things I want Android to do to make it better:1. Make it visually more attractive and colourful (may be by having colorful toggles in the notification shade and colourful notification badges).2. Default messaging app should also work like whatsapp or something ( or they should just buy whatsapp). RCS is....bad.3. Remove useless third parties from play store.4. Add more functionality to google assistant while offline.5. Give google drive a more organized look and make it more usable.6. Get something that works like animoji (Not bitmoji).7. Include commonly used tools like video editor  a better photo editor and a better sharing tool in the UI.PS: Copy if you agree and suggest something else too.,False

It might fix your isuues!👍 (Otherwise it's your OEMs fault),False

1453,Eriatolc,@Flaying Cat Well  contrary to brands using Android as OS  Apple recycles the parts of its devices. And your point is not really well-founded.,False
1454,Flaying Cat,@Eriatolc i get your point but why are u humiliate Android as a twopenny OS  like they onlu know cheap 5 year old Android device-,False
1455,Eriatolc,@Flaying Cat Hmm  let me think.I understand that some people may appreciate the Android user interface  and I also understand that my original comment was "a little" hard on that. BUT  I think a lot of Android's processes are bad  like being able to download an application from the Play Store when it contains malware  or the fact that Google also resells some of your phone's data for targeted ads.I agree  it's not just an aesthetic problem ;),False
1456,Flaying Cat,@Eriatolc most of android users knows what they doing and yes there are some applications that contain malwares but there are rarely. And for all IOS users dont think android devices are only for poor because mostly Iphone parts are from android company☠like your display is from samsung  Iphone's camera sensor is from sony and also there are android phones that much more expensive than iphones. Dont be so close-tech minded 💖,False
1457,Eriatolc,Flaying Cat We could be debating this topic for many more hours  and you are an interesting person to debate with.It is entirely true that many parts of Apple's products come from outside companies  and I have no problem with them  but with their common operating system (´｡• ω •｡`),False

1834,Bean_Flare Gaming,(Google Pixel 3a XL  is the phone I have) I don't really like the Android 11. It makes my apps all act up. Some close by themselves  some don't even show on they're running in the background. Like Spotify. It use to have the icon on the top bar menu where you have the time  like at the very top. And now  it doesn't show anything  and when it closes  music still is playing. Like I literally have to play pause  and the close it in order to close the full app. And it doesn't use to do that. And it's not the only app  most of my media apps  glitch out and when I close them.. they're still running. Like the sound is still playing like if I'm still playing the app. And I can't even find the screen recording feature. Oh and the screenshot option on the power button is completely ruined. I have to press the down volume button and power button at the same time and I didn't have to do that before  it made it easier for me. 😕😕I should've stayed with Android 10 it was running much smoother. .,False

1899,GeorgeKutty Jimmy,😍😍😍,False
1900,notstarboard,Android 11 feels like a step backward to be honest. Pros so far:* I like the screen recorder.* I like the one-time permissions.* Auto-resetting permissions is useless for me  but on the whole I think it's a helpful thing to add for people who don't pay attention.* I don't use Android Auto and I don't have any connected devices  but I'm sure those improvements are nice for people who use them.Cons so far:* The "Conversations" and "Notifications" dividers take up a lot of space and just result in more scrolling if you have a lot of notifications. If you don't have a lot of notifications  they're irrelevant. This is a step up for grandma who doesn't know how to shut off notifications for Candy Crush and has perpetual clutter in her notifications shade. This is a pain in the ass for someone like me that only has notifications enabled that I want to see. I feel the same way about the AI notification management feature. I already have all unwanted notifications disabled. I don't need a robot to "help" and possibly mess up my existing notifications.* There is so much extra padding in the notifications around profile pictures  above and below messages  on the outsides of messages  etc. that information density in the notifications shade is worse than I think it's even been in Android. You basically need to expand every incoming message notification in order to read it because there's so much padding that there's very little room to display the text. Media notifications are ugly as hell for the same reason; there's so much padding that it's a "..." fest in the song and artist names unless you expand the notification.* There are now only 6 quick settings visible when expanding the quick settings menu instead of 9. 95% of the time I expanded the quick settings menu on Android 10 was to access quick settings toggles in slots 7-9. Now I need to scroll to the next page every time I want to turn on my flashlight or turn on battery saver. * I think bubbles are useless  and I would suspect that most people who like them are probably just used to Facebook. They get in the way of meaningful information  add clutter to your screen  and I also find them distracting. I don't see any advantage to them versus just opening your notification shade (aside from the fact that notifications are also bad now lol). At least you can turn them off.* The update broke gestures on Nova Launcher  but thankfully undefaulting and redefaulting it fixed it. Nova does have to redraw the desktop a lot more frequently on Android 11 for some reason  though.* The recent apps screen changes are terrible. We already have power + volume down to take a screenshot. Why do we need a "screenshot" button in the recent apps? Is this prepping for button-less phones before they exist  or is this because Google thinks people don't know how to take a screenshot and doesn't want to teach them? Also  the "Select" button straight up doesn't work for me. I don't know if it's because I disabled the Google app  or if it only works on Pixel Launcher  or what  but it is a dedicated button that doesn't do jack shit. So  both buttons on the recent apps screen are useless. * After being able to dismiss recommended settings on day 1  I now can't dismiss them on day 2. I am so fucking done with Google trying to help me  failing miserably  and wasting prime real estate in apps I use every day. This applies to almost every Google app I use  not even just Android. YouTube / YTM  Google Maps  etc. have the same issue. This is a theme throughout Android  now more than ever. Casual UX >>> power user UXOther:* My phone still vibrates when I unlock it with the fingerprint sensor despite haptic feedback being completely off in the settings. This worked fine on Android 9  and it worked fine on Android 10 until I made the mistake of turning on haptic feedback and then turning it off again. So  not a new issue with Android 11  but it still drives me nuts.TL;DR I like high information density and I hate wasted space. Android 11 decreases the former and increases the latter. The new features aren't nearly worth it to me.,False

2090,Spikatrix,Plus a bunch of "features" requiring more RAM  more severe storage and permission restrictions which will result in several apps having to resort to ugly ways to get stuff done or even impossible resulting in bad reviews for apps even though developers are trying their best.

2117,FLIM : Gaming Stuff,People who are saying stuff like  "Already in Samsung"  "OneUI has them ALL!" and more  they actually need to learn a LOT!What does OneUI run on? It is ANDROID only!
