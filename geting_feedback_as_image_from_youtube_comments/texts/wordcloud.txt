"Office 365 has been configured to prevent individual acquisition of Office Store Add-ins"
I just clicked as a joke. Like "no way you can do this on Word". Lol thanks a lot!
A very useful tutorial and easy to do in MS Word! Thanks for the tips.
Thanks for sharing. I`m using  Office 365. Could perfectly follow you in every step. But my cloud shows same sice fonts for every word. Couldn´t make it vary the font size randomly from one word to another. Have any clue?
Thank you very much .....I’ve never come across add ins before or developer  but this was easy to follow and clearly explained.
How do I keep a two word phrase together in this add-in?
It won’t let me copy the word cloud and I don’t know how to save the word cloud is there another way to save it??
This was so helpful!! Thank you so much! I've been struggling with how to create one...and you just saved me! Again  thank you!
I'm right clicking on the word cloud to save it  however no save as option is appearing. Nothing shows up when I right click. I followed the instructions to the T. Do you know what the issue could be?
Thank you  I got stuck at the add-in's tab  you page has three options to choose from. My word page only had the two options for add-ins  I am missing the blue add-in that you clicked on.  thanks for any feedback.
You just saved me a TON of time - thank you!
I've been looking to do this for years.  Thank you.
Whoa! Nice! Thank you sir! Did you write this program? You're awesome.
Awesome!  Thank you!!! Clear  concise and easy to follow!  I can't thank you enough!
Great Tutorial that taught me how to create a Word Cloud very easily. Thanks !!
Hey. i use microsoft word 2010 coming to add ins there is a different box  opened plz help me

Thank you so very much. I was just about to pay someone to create one for me. Peace & blessings!
Thanks it helped in my computer homework!!
Thank you for the step by step including how to get additional tabs and add ins those are the things frequently missing from computer tutorials that leave me completely perplexed!
Thank you so much! This helps me a ton! :D
Wow  thank you so much. this is way easier than writing script in R (for simple analysis of course) :)
it appears "pro word cloud" add in is not available with Word for Mac.  Any suggestions?
THANK YOU for making this!
Thank you that was very helpful.  I needed to do this for one of my Directors.  Easy.
Superb  kudos for the great and easy explanation  much appreciated for your help  hope all at home are well.
One of the most useful tutorials I've seen  thank you. Much better than all those pesky chrome extensions and software installs
Thank you  very nice.  Just one question  is there any way to have specific words larger or centered?
what version of word are you using? I can open the developer tab but cannot see Office ad-ins.

so helpful  thank you!
Thank you for this tutorial. This is very useful.
Hey  great tutorial. Quick question though. Can you use the word cloud commercially? Like on a t-shirt?
This is awesome. Thank you very much!  I need it.
thank you for this  nice clear instructions  very useful information.
It really  helped me a lot. Very didactic  or course. Thanks.

Fabulous tutorial. Thank you!
Thanks  worked great  very easy to follow. :)
Thanks a million for this video. It was very useful for my class assignment. God bless you.
Thank you - extremely useful.  One tip - if you're using Office 365 you need to be logged into your microsoft account in order to be able to download the app from the store.
This was great. Thank you.
Thank you for a great tutorial - worked like a charm. Can anyone tell me how to change the fonts to various sizes like the example ? Mine are all the same even though I altered some to different sizes in the document.
Thanks. Great find!
this was excellent - thanks!
Thank you very much.  Once you close the "Pro Word Cloud" side panel  how do you reopen to create another cloud?
This was very helpful. Thank you.

Useful  but then how could you make the word cloud fit into a specific shape?
Awesome. Thank you so much!
Really straight forward and useful thanks!
Very clear and helpful tutorial. Thank you. I'm using Word 2016 and the plug-in works fine. Lots of options so you can play around creating different word clouds until you get one that looks good to you.
Thanks. This is really helpful.
Thanks. This was helpful.
Thank you! At work  and needed this video. Very Useful.
This is awesome - thanks!  As a side note  here in 2019  I can't seem to right click the image to copy or save (but you can drag and drop).  They must've made a change since you recorded this.  Still  it's a great too :)
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

Just go to the Developer tab and click 'Add-ins'
Thanks Naz  glad you found it useful.
I'm very glad you found the tutorial useful. What do you mean about changing the font sizes though? The relative sizes are set automatically depending upon the frequency of the words.
You're very welcome Barbara!

I am very thankful you have taking the time to create this video to share. It was extremely helpful
I can't right click on the word cloud to save it.
Thank you - using this with hospital mission statements.
Thanks! Very clear and straight to the point  excellent tutorial!
Can this be possible in ms word 2010?
All great  EXCEPT that I don't have Pro Word Cloud in MS Store  or anything even resembles this  Canada Nov 2018.   Cheers.   Nice to see Developer Tab anyway.

Excellent Tutorial!
Thanks for the tutorial. There's a scenario where I have two words that should appear in the word cloud together. For example "Apple iPhone". However when the word cloud is created  the words are considered disconnected and don't appear together. How do I address this?
Orpheus Pro Word Cloud not available for Word for the Mac as at today's date. Could not do this. :(
Thank you!
Thank you!
brilliant and easy  thanks.
Good job. Helped me so much.
Excellent video. This is what I was looking for...very easy to do!
Many Thanks. It's very useful. Hope that it will integrate commonwords and endpoints for French
Excellent info!!! Easy to follow! Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot!!! 😁
Very useful and easy to follow  thank you.
This was great! So informative - I'd never heard of 'developer'  love it - thank you!!
Is there any way to create an interactive word cloud. I mean clicking on any word of the word cloud would highlight all the transaction where the word appears?
Very helpful and didactic! Thanks
super helpful.  thank you!!
Thanks for sharing this. Very helpful
Beautiful!
Yay brilliant I've subscribed. Did not know about developer tab
Really useful video - thanks so much.  I will be able to create more word clouds for use in my lessons.
You're very welcome!
Same issue here  Did you find a solution?
You're extremely welcome!
Hello Lisa  I'm so glad you feel it will be useful for you. Good luck with your hospital work.
Ha ha! I believe that would have been the delightful children playing on the field next to my house having a quiet discussion about whether a goal should be allowed or not. I'm very glad the video was useful for you!
You're very welcome!
You're extremely welcome!
Double-click it. Then you can change the font or add a highlight colour using the standard font tools.
You're very welcome!
I'm so sorry it;s taken me a while to catch up with comments  but I do appreciate yours and I'm so glad you subscribed! The little formula at the beginning is just to add dummy text. In Word type =lorem(a b)  where 'a' is the number of paragraphs you want and 'b' is the number of sentences in each paragraph.
Thank you  I'm glad you liked it.
Well done! Glad I could help.
I'm glad you liked this tutorial. With this addon you wouldn't be able to do that without using a hyphen to connect the two words together. You'll find this is the case with most word cloud generators.
You're extremely welcome!
Thanks for the information from Las Vegas
I can not find the "store" option in the add on tab. I have Microsoft 2013. Can you help please.Thanks!
how do you omit irrelevant words  such as "and"   "in"  "to"  and so forth? or adding common words to remove
Thanks a lot!! Is this available in all languages?
My Add Ins form doesnt look anything like that and I have MS Word 2013
Thank you so much!
how to do it in Office 2007
Thank you so much.
Well-done video. Easy to follow.
Super helpful!
You are so great. Thank you so much
incredibly easy and very clear instructions.  Thank you.
Can this work in MS Word for Mac?
very good add in   but the quality of the picture which it makes is too low.
It would be great to have shapes to put these words in - like wordle did (but Wordle does not work now)
looked just what I wanted except I can't save to Gallery or get right-click Copy option :(
Awesome! Thank you
Thanks for this! Very handy
hello when  I Click in go they told me that  it's not working please help me
thanks so much  very useful
Thank you Jill! Your support is very much appreciated  and I hope you find more useful content. More VBA/Developer tab content already on its way!
Thank you  you're very welcome!
I'm so glad you found it useful. I love the Developer tab  and have produced many videos which show ways you can use it.
Thank you so much Claudia  I'm glad you thought so.
I'm so glad it helped!

You're very welcome!
Thank you!
What about MS Office 2010?
I dont see any Pro Word Cloud addon or any Word Cloud addon in the store... (i'm using the word of Office 365 Mac edition)
thanks you saved my life
Nice video  but couldn't find add ins store in my version ;-(
can this word cloud be pulled up as a custom visual Power BI?
Right click does not work- left click and "drag" to your document (updated 6/2020)
Easy to follow video  except it did not work.  I successfully created my word cloud as instructed and then I was unable to right click in order to copy or save as a file.  Then I tried to "Save to Gallery" and that did not work for me either.  So I created a beautiful design  but I am unable to use it.  But thanks for helping learn more about Microsoft Add Ons.
Liked the video. How do  you make sure that two word phrases stay together such as 'talent management'. I have seen in other tutorials that you put the tilde (~) between the words to keep them together but with this it just keeps the tilde there.  Appreciate the help.
Very easy to follow - thank you
Thanks! Very helpful! even 5 years later!!!!
Super useful!
Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!  Straight and to the point  easy to follow  exactly what I wanted!  Super job!
Whats the app called for a macbook?

Awesome!  Thank you - easy to follow.
i am using 2013 version and i found insert - store -  pro word cloud... But when m doing sign in i dont know why its not accepting..my password is correct though. can u help plz?
Great tool! Only option that's missing is - it works only with solo words  but does not recognize phrases...
I can't find the pro word cloud add-on....
Very useful and extremely clear.
VERY USEFUL. Do you do anything on skill share?
You're very welcome!
You're very welcome!
Thank you!
You're very welcome!
You're very welcome Macrina Xavier!
+Tenezee Gehndyu Hello  in the video I'm using Word 2016  and so the interface does look a little bit different. In older versions of Word not all addins will be available. I'm not sure about this one as I'm afraid I haven't tried it in Word 2013 myself.
+The Tech Train Thank you for clearing that up! I found the correct Add-Ins button  it is actually under the inserts tab. I have to download Pro Word Cloud first and then go the Insert tab  and click the Add-Ins button which showed Pro-Word Cloud option. Once I clicked that and was able to create my Word Cloud.
+Tenezee Gehndyu Fantastic! I hope you enjoy using the addon. Thanks for sharing the location and method too.
In Word 2013 it's under Insert > My Add-ins
Hi Tenezee  Thank you.. this was helpful to me as well.
Unfortunately I believe this particular add-on is no longer available. I'm currently looking at alternatives  and will make a new video shortly. This version wound have supported multiple languages  as I believe most alternatives will.
You're very welcome  from Yorkshire!
So simple  thanks
Can it work for Chinese?
But how do you create a word cloud that incorporates compound words?! Can't find a solution.
Excellent video!
How to download this software. Please sent this software download link.
Can't seem to find pro word cloud by orpheus (October 2019)
Is there a way to do phrases vs just words?
ace so clear excellent teaching
OK! Well  that did not help me one tiny little bit!  How do I find  install  these add-ins?  Sure I have the Tab  and sure I have some add-ins available  but I want to find one in particular ... Pro Word Cloud ... BUT! what I'm really looking for is a method / tool / add-in that will generate a 'list of words used' and 'how many times each word was used.  I have MS Office 2010 and NO I am not willing to spend hundreds more for a newer version  and NO I do not wish to use macros.
Is there a limitation on text content size? number of words? or does it needs any formatting of text? I was trying to generate word cloud from survey results ( comments part).
I can't find this add on in Microsoft Office word for MAC - do this mean it's not there?
How come i do not see the Add in icon (the one you are clicking) under the Developer tab.
How can I count the repeated words per quantity ?
How come your words are in different sizes? Mine does just 1 size... Anyone? :/
Very easily understood tutorial.  Is there a way to change the shape of the word cloud?  For example  you often see word clouds in the shape of a tree or a heart.  If that is possible  a demo of that would be great.
I cant see the link to install the pro word cloud in my ms word 2013.so  what can I do access it?
Its very Useful... Tks
Very good. Adding the developer tab is not something I knew even existed  but it opens up all kinds of possibilities with Word. Many thanks.
Excellent - will try.
A very useful videoThank you sir
Thank you  I'm glad you like it. I have looked at Skill Share actually  but to be honest at the moment I'm still working full time as a teacher  working in two different schools  and balancing that with family isn't easy  so large projects like that are on a list at the moment. However  I'm hoping to drop to part time teaching and spend more time on YouTube and other platforms  such as Skill Share  instead. Watch this space  and help spread the word about the channel so I can take the occasional step outside my classroom!
Thank you very much!
doesn't seem to exist in the store for mac users
Thank you very much! So glad you found it useful.
Thank you very much!
Thank you  I'm so glad you like it. I'm actually working on a revised version of this video as times have changed  and I don't think this add-on is supported now  so if you like this idea be sure to keep an eye on this channel for some new suggestions for this sort of thing.
Try using the snipping tool to take a screen shot of the word cloud and save that.
I'm afraid I don't think there's any way for it to be dynamically altered in that way.
I believe they have recently discontinued that particular add-on unfortunately  but I'll be publishing a new video shortly which demonstrates three alternatives.
I'm afraid it's not currently available for Mac  only Windows.
I'm afraid I only have 2016 installed  I'm not too sure.
Doesn't existing the MS Store for Word 2016 for Mac
Does anyone have an idea how I would be able to list the phrase 'Full life cycle recruiting'' without it breaking up into separate words? I tried to use the tilde (~) in between the words but that only includes it  in the cloud. Everything works perfectly. Thank you.
Word clouds are fun to create.
Can't find Pro Word Cloud.......
unfortunately  pro word cloud frequently does not allow you to right-click to save your word cloud.  That stinks.  Hundreds of people have experienced this over the years.  How about telling us how Orpheus plans to fix their add-in?
Es una gran ayuda
Thank you so much!! This was very helpful for me!!
This does not work with MS Word below the 2013 issue. Moreover  downloading the programme requires signing up to a thing called "Microsoft AppSource" which patronizingly will not let you sign in with your private account but asks for a workplace account (i.e. if you are working for a company or the like). This is extremely annoying.
thank you
didn't work  would not load
Really helpful. Thanks
Not available for Word 2010
Unable to copy -- right click doesn't do anything. any ideas??
Very useful - tq!
There is no mention that this doesn't work on the Mac  at least not in Office 2011.  There is no "Store" available in the Developer Add Ins feature.(I know  2011 may seem old.  Yes I do resist Microsoft "upgrades" since my workflow is so often trashed by the features they have removed.)
I was half-expecting you to sell us a plugin. It happens all the time when I'm looking for a quick and easy tutorial. Thx! Using a word cloud in a word doc right now to show how many times a word came up in survey results.
I found the Developer tab  but there isn't an option to go to the "store" to find the Pro Word Cloud.  Any advice?
I am attempting to do this in Word (2017). Do you think that plug-in does not exist in 2017? I downloaded 2016  but then updated when it asked me to. I do not see the add-in called "Pro Word Cloud" when I search for it. Unfortunately  I did not check before I updated it. Any insight would be great! Thanks!
yees ma am
This video is great
You're very welcome!
You're very welcome!
In Word 2013 it's under Insert > My Add-ins
I'm sorry  I'm not sure what you mean?
+Dippydi Dipp Which version of Word are you using?
I actually found the Add in button. It was just located in another place. Completed the word cloud! Thanks for the clear video!
+Dippydi Dipp Oh great  I'm glad you got it all right. Don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already!
Hello Laila  I'm not aware of any other addon for Word that does what you're looking for I'm afraid  but you may find a website offering such a facility. If it generates a word cloud as an image you could perhaps then import that? Maybe look st https://www.wordclouds.com/
Thank you very much!
Not with this addon  you'd need to either use underscores between the words  or use an alternative solution.
Me neither - I think this is out of date now
same here
In the video I show you how to get it. It's not separate software - it's an Addin which you can get within Microsoft Word.
Thank you!
You'd need to either add an underscore (not ideal I know) or use a different solution  such as an online word cloud generator.
Using an underscore's not a bad idea. Thanks for the suggestion!
You're welcome  I hope that works for you all right.
You're welcome!
Very nice

good to a point   but I don't understand what was  that  final picture  of  scrambled words  you put on the  page    just a picture  or ' the cloud'? and how do you access the word  document then   from   any cell phone or laptop  if you created this on your pc?..where is the central place? where is the cloud?
Thank you
Ummmm.? 🤨
It looks like it is not available for mac. :( I wish I had realized that before I purchased Microsoft Office because this add-in in the main reason I purchased it. Guess I should look into it more next time before downloading Office. :(
I'm so sorry  but I'm afraid I only use a PC  so don't have Mac experience I can share. There are online word cloud tools you can use perhaps?
You're probably using an older version of Microsoft Word. This option is available with newer versions of Word. I'm using Office 365.
@The Tech Train I'm using Office 365 as well and it worked great  but I am unable to right click and copy it to my document.  Do you know why?
I'm so glad. You're welcome.
I've just checked and it;s definitely still listed.
Indeed!
Unfortunately not with this addin. You could try using the underscore.
Unfortunately I can't advise as I only use a PC  and don't have a Mac.
Word clouds are a type of diagram in which the words of a document are displayed according to their frequency. Words which are most used tend to be larger  and often towards the middle  whereas less frequently used words are smaller and fill the gaps. As well as being interesting they are often seen as being decorative too. (And as for where 'the cloud' is - the cloud is just somebody else's computer!)
Thank you!
